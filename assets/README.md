# Assets Folder

This folder is for storing game assets such as:

- 3D models
- Textures
- Sound effects
- Music

Currently, the game uses simple geometric shapes for all objects, but in future updates, more complex models and textures can be added here.

## Structure

- `models/` - For 3D models
- `textures/` - For texture images
- `sounds/` - For audio files
